# FinalProjectG4
[Package Repository:FinalProjectG4] (https://github.com/AU-R-Programming/FinalProjectG4)

The package name is `FinalProjectG4` and the function used in the package is called `g4lmfunc`. This can be seen as an alternative of in-built linear regression functions in `R`. The user must provide the response, predictors. Significance level is optional, it is 0.05 by default. It can also be changed by the user.

The package can be downloaded by using the `devtools::install_github` function. After downloading the package, we need to call the function `g4lmfunc`. After activating the function, it is ready to use. We apply our function to the `crop.data.csv` dataset as an example. We take the yield as response and density, block, fertilizer as predictors.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(g4lmfunc)
cropdata = read.csv("C:/Users/yagmu/Desktop/Auburn/Courses/Fall21/Stat6210/Github/FinalProjectG4/crop.data.csv")
resp = cropdata$yield
pred = cbind(cropdata$density, cropdata$block, cropdata$fertilizer)
fitlm_our = our_lm(resp, pred, alpha = 0.05)
fitlm_our
```
