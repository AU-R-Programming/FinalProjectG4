# FinalProjectG4
[Package Repository:FinalProjectG4] (https://github.com/AU-R-Programming/FinalProjectG4)

The package name is `FinalProjectG4` and the function used in the package is called `g4lmfunc`. The function within the package, `our_lm` can be seen as an alternative of in-built linear regression functions in `R`. 

The user must provide the response and predictors; a significance level (alpha) is optional and can be changed by the user, but it remains 0.05 by default.
`resp` : A vector of length n that represents a dependent variable we would like to explain/predict.
`pred` : A matrix of dimension nxp; this matrix is an independent variable used to predict resp and beta.

The package can be downloaded by using the `devtools::install_github` function. After downloading the package, we need to call the function `g4lmfunc`. After activating the function, it is ready to use. We apply our function to the `crop.data.csv` dataset as an example. We take the yield as response and density, block, and fertilizer as predictors.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(g4lmfunc)
cropdata = read.csv("C:/Users/yagmu/Desktop/Auburn/Courses/Fall21/Stat6210/Github/FinalProjectG4/crop.data.csv")
resp = cropdata$yield
pred = cbind(cropdata$density, cropdata$block, cropdata$fertilizer)
fitlm_our = our_lm(resp, pred, alpha = 0.05)
fitlm_our
```
