\[Package Repository:FinalProjectG4\]
(<https://github.com/AU-R-Programming/FinalProjectG4>)
The repository name is `FinalProjectG4`, and the package within is titled `g4lmfunc`. Included in this package is the function `our_lm` which can be seen as an alternative of in-built linear regression functions in `R`. 

The user must provide the response and predictors; a significance level (alpha) is optional and can be changed by the user, but it remains 0.05 by default.
`resp` : A vector of length n that represents a dependent variable we would like to explain/predict.
`pred` : A matrix of dimension nxp; this matrix is an independent variable used to predict resp and beta.

The package can be downloaded by using the `devtools::install_github` function. After downloading the package, the function `our_lm` may be utilized once retrieving the package with `libarary(g4lmfunc)`. We apply our function to the `crop.data.csv` data set as an example by taking the yield as response and density, block, and fertilizer as predictors.

After running the sample code above, plots including residuals vs fitted-values, a qq-plot of residuals, and a histogram (or density) of residuals are made available. Further analysis of the `our_lm` function includes the return of an estimated coefficient vector Î² of length p via optimization, a confidence interval, R^2 and C_p values, as well as an F statistic and p value.
