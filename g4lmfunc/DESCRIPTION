Description:  
    This package performs linear regression for which the parameter vector β of 
length p is estimated using optimization. The user is able to choose the 
significance level α to obtain the 1-alpha confidence intervals for beta.
Moreover, plots are available to compare residuals vs fitted-values and view a 
qq-plot and histogram of residuals. R^2 and C_p values are included, and the 
user may perform a test using an F-test statistic and p-values.
